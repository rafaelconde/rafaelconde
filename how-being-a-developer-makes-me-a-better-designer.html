      <h1>How being a developer makes me a better designer</h1>

      <p><em class="aside">This is a transcript of a talk originally present at MOBX conference in Berlin, 2016.</em></p>

      <p>I've decided to name this talk &quot;How being a developer makes me a better designer&quot;, and some of you might be thinking &quot;is this going to be another should designers code Twitter drama?&quot;—No. This is about how being a developer, makes <em>me</em> a better designer.</p>

      <p>In 2009 I went to college, to study Computer Science. Why? Because when I was 5 years old, I wrote my first video game using my own programming language which was later bought by Microsoft for 100 million dollars… That's not true.</p>

      <p>I liked computers and I liked video games, and it was apparent to me, even back then, that everything has software in it. Your micro-wave has software, your fridge, your TV, heck, even my skateboard has software now. Last month I stayed at a friends' place in San Francisco, and his mattress has an app — crazy talk.</p>

      <p>So if everything in the world is going to have software, I want to understand software so that I can understand the world—makes sense?</p>

      <p>Everyone is on Facebook on their phones all the time, yet they have no idea what that <strong>is</strong> in reality.</p>

      <p>So I went to study Computer Science, and, turns out, it's super boring! I was doing poorly, I was a terrible student. I was doing <em>enough</em> so that the university didn't kick me out — that's how low my bar was. On my third year I had this course called Human Computer Interaction, in where they teach you the very basics of user interface design — things like &quot;why is a button a rectangle, with drop-shadows&quot; (like it used to have in the past, or like it has now again…?!).</p>

      <p>And I was like &quot;OMG&quot;, turns out design is not this artsy-fartsy thing that people come up with, design is based in logic, in reason — there's good design and bad design (there's a lot of ways to do good design, but there's also a ton of ways of doing bad design). And that was a break-through, this all made a lot of sense to me.</p>

      <p>So, during the rest of that school year, for some reason the folks at Bohemian Coding gave me a promo code to download Sketch, and I started playing around with it, at that same time, Facebook release Facebook Home, which was this weird skin/theme for Android, but it became known that the designers who worked on it were using Quartz Composer to prototype interactions, and I also started playing with that.
      So by the end of that year, I had somehow some kind of portfolio, I was doing unsolicited designs. If I saw an app that I thought was crap, me being a smartass was like &quot;this is crap, I'm gonna make this way better!&quot;, and then proceed to email the people who made it saying &quot;This is better, look at it!&quot;. </p>

      <p>I never got an answer.</p>

      <p>But, I had a portfolio, and I googled &quot;Best startups in Lisbon&quot;, picked 5, got a train ticket, literally knocked at their office doors, and said &quot;Hey I'm a designer, I can help you&quot;.</p>

      <p>For some reason, the guys at Think Orange gave me a job.
      I will be forever grateful to them!</p>

      <p>We were a very small team, and even though I was hired as a designer, I also had to help with some front-end design work (we were building websites, mostly) — and that means that, sure, I was the designer, but most likely I was going to be the one who had to code those mockups – which means that I couldn't go completely crazy with my design chops, because I would have to code it.
      And because I wasn't a very good front-end developer, it forced be to be a very shy and conservative designer.</p>

      <p>At this same time, I started doing this thing on the side called SketchCasts. Sketch was the only thing that I knew, really, or the only thing that I was barely good at. So I started recording a weekly video screencast tutorial, teaching Sketch. And I charged for a membership—people could pay $8 a month and watch a new video every week.</p>

      <p>A year later I joined this other company, we were bigger, and I joined my first design team where I learned a lot about the process, things like benchmarking, user research, proper wireframming, all of that good stuff.
      I also got into prototyping, especially Framer, and so I teamed up with a friend of mine and built this app called Frames, which was an iOS companion app for Framer, in where you could live preview, and save it offline and all.</p>

      <p>And then something amazing happened: my side projects were making me <em>as much</em> money as my day job. So I decided to quit my job, effectively taking a 50% cut on my total income, but I could focus on my side projects full time.</p>

      <p>Because I had a lot of free time now, I decided to build a game—why not?</p>

      <p>It's called Break this Safe, and let me tell you a quick story about this game:</p>

      <p>The year was 2014, and Apple just announced the Apple Watch, and it was the first new product category from Apple since the iPhone (I know the iPad came out in 2010, but the iPad was just &quot;a big phone&quot; right?), and I was really into it. I remember John Gruber said that &quot;the Digital Crown feel amazing, it has the most amazing feel of any analogue controller I've ever used&quot;. I didn't own an Apple Watch, but I became obsessed with this Digital Crown, it was a brand new input method, and it sounded like it was a pretty great one.</p>

      <p>Because I didn't have an Apple Watch, I could only image this &quot;amazing feel&quot; of the crown, and for some reason, I always imagined it similar to one of those safe dials, right? That's how it should feel like I think, and honestly, we could even make a game in where you would turn the crown, and that would turn this safe dial, like a game...</p>

      <p>That could work!</p>

      <p>It couldn't, because you couldn't build third party apps, I didn't know how to write apps, and I didn't even owned a watch.</p>

      <p>The following year, 2015, Apple held the annual WWDC and announced watchOS 2, and now you <em>could</em> build native apps. Coincidentally, in that same WWDC week I was in London, and managed to find one of 2 stores in the whole world that had Apple Watches in stock, and sold them, so I manage to buy a Watch.</p>

      <p>I was also watching this show called Sense8 (truly amazing and special show, it's on Netflix, you should watch it) and in the first episode, this character called Wolfgang (the coolest name ever) is trying to break into this safe, and he's wearing headphones, trying to hear the subtle clicks of the dial, it's all very intense, he's sweating… </p>

      <p>And I was like &quot;OMG, I TOTALLY KNOW HOW THIS GAME WOULD WORK&quot; you would have your watch, the crown is the dial, you turn the crown, you turn the dial, and you would have to listen and feel the haptic feedback in your wrist, and one of the vibrations will be stronger than the others… and that's it, that's the game.</p>

      <p>So I learned how to write Swift, and I built a game. watchOS 2 was very new, and you could only do so much, which was great when you were just starting out — you only have this limited number of things you could do.</p>

      <p>So, first things first, you would have an image of a dial, you turn the crown, you rotate the image. Cool, first step.</p>

      <p>Turns out, you couldn't rotate images on watchOS 2.</p>

      <p>So the only way that I couldn't find to make this happen, was to create 100 different images, and just scroll through them.</p>

      <p>Genius.</p>

      <p>It took me 3 months to be able to load 100 images into memory, and not have it crash. 3 months to rotate an image.</p>

      <p>I wrote a case study on this: breakthissafe.com</p>

      <p>During this process, I wasn't a designer, or a developer, I was a guy building an app.</p>

      <p>I never designed mockups for this. It was all in my head.
      There was no handoff to the &quot;dev&quot;, there wasn't Rafa the designer and Rafa the engineer — it was Rafa building this thing.</p>

      <hr />

      <p>And then I joined Netlify.</p>

      <p>When I joined we were just about to re-write our whole app in React, and because I had been in web development for a year or so, everything was new, and React was new to me.</p>

      <p>Turns out, React is pretty great, it's an interesting mental model in where everything in a UI is a component. A button is a component, a navigation bar is a component, a header is a component, and a whole page can be a component.</p>

      <p>So, if we are going to build this with components, let me design it with this mental model as well.</p>

      <p>How does this translates to Sketch and our design tools?</p>

      <p>Well, we use symbols, and nested symbols.</p>

      <p>Blah blah blah, Brad Frost, atomic design, blah blah...
      But it's pretty spot on — I started building small and smaller components, and then build up from that — one symbol at a time, using Abstract as both our version control app but as our team's source of truth for all design work.</p>

      <p>Thinking in components, and in git committing my design work forced a mentality shift in me that I still carry it to today.</p>

      <p>This is all great, but I'm just designing mockups.
      These are just pretty pictures, this is a blueprint for an idea, it means nothing until we build it.</p>

      <p>I can't approach a user, send a couple of PNGs and ask &quot;hey, isn't this amazing? Use it!&quot;.</p>

      <p>So it was time to implement this work.
      We started using this tool called React Storybook, and it was a break-through.</p>

      <p>Using Storybook allows the team to design components in the vacuum, without worrying about screwing something up in the actual production app — it also forced us to design and build these components without the constraints and context of the bigger picture.</p>

      <p>&quot;Is this Card component actually 1200px wide because that's the way it is, or is it just 100% the width of the parent container? What would this look without any container? What are the actual states that we have to take in consideration? What does it look like if the API returns... nothing? You get the point.</p>

      <p>&quot;To a client or a user, designer and developer can be just words, just like our job titles.</p>

      <p>This perspective helped us understand that in reality we are nothing but a bunch of people working together on a project&quot;.</p>

      <hr />

      <p>So before I go, I want to share this thing that I found online.
      This group of people decided to ask this other group of people to draw a bicycle.</p>

      <p>Before I show you the results... who here (reading this) hasn't ride a bike before? Who hasn't ever seen a bicycle in real life?</p>

      <p>(If you haven't, you should do it, it's amazing!)</p>

      <p>[picture of the bike drawings]</p>

      <p>We are all very familiar with bicycles, we don't bat an eye at one, some of you might probably ride bikes all the time (if you're Dutch at least), <strong>but we have no idea how they work</strong>.</p>

      <p>And it's eye opening to see that if you truly don't understand how something works, how can one expect to be able to draw it... or design it?</p>

      <p>And that's how being a developer makes me a better designer, in order for me to expect me to do a good job at designing something, I <strong>need</strong> to know how it works, even if I can't write all of the code, think complex backend magic, I need to understand the basics of how it works to do a good job, and I think you should too.</p>

      <p>I want to remind everyone that at the end of the day, my job is not to draw cool bitmaps, your job is not to write JavaScript, we are all building things, we are all creating something, and each of us contribute in different ways, but that's the goal.</p>
